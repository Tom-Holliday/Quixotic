The unstoppable rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in
financial markets could be facing its first major reckoning. 

Once hailed as the next big thing, AI’s grip is now being
questioned, with critics likening its meteoric rise to the 1990s Dot Com
bubble. 

A damning MIT report reveals 95 per cent of firms are
seeing no returns on Ai investments, while NVIDIA stock recently suffered a 3.5
per cent intra-day drop. 

The result? A growing divide among investors, split between
fears of an AI bubble and confidence in its staying power. 

Speaking with Andrew Elphick, former Barclay’s Head of
Fintech Strategy and Open Innovation, the expert brushed aside concerns of an
AI bubble. 

“You’re going to have an adoption curve,” he said,
comparing the AI boom to other major technology trends. 

He argued the current AI hype is “different” from the Dot
Com bubble of the 1990s. 

“Now you have a greater capacity to test whether something
actually works so you can make something enterprise ready,” he added, pointing to
how vapourware plagued the 90s tech scene.

When asked whether the bubble will burst, Elphick was
unconvinced. 

He said: “I’m not convinced it will burst. They haven’t hit
the ceiling with what is possible with AI.”

However, he warned against blind trust in AI, stating: “If
we’re not thinking about kicking the tyres on what Gen AI produces, then we’ll
end up causing ourselves a lot of issues.”
