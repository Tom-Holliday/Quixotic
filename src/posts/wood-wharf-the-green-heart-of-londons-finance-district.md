Emerging
from the surprisingly clean underbelly of Canary Wharf tube station, I was
greeted by something equally surprising. The sunshine. 

In
addition to this, a newly developed piece of urban planning at the centre of
London’s concrete jungle. Wood Wharf. 

An
unlikely addition at the heart of the former docklands area, Wood Wharf sports
a mercurially modern harmony of green space, open air planning and in all
obviousness, a proclivity for contemporary wooden architecture. 

Now a
hub of modern culture, the area plays host to a litany of bustling shops and
restaurants. 

Additionally,
a collection of charmingly themed art works. 

Speaking
with Stefano Amato, a London novice and receptionist of two weeks to the newly
refurbished Revolut tower, he had this to say. 

“I
find it tranquil. A great place to work as well as eat lunch during the day.
All around a very nice place to be”. 

Two Revolut
employees declined to comment. 

A
formerly frequent visitor of the banking district, I recall memories of a
harsh, grey area comprised of a group of rather intimidating high-rises
supplemented by their equally intimidating suit-cladded inhabitants. 

Opinions
change however. 

Famous
as the beating heart of global finance, Canary Wharf once carried with it a
preconception as an unwaveringly anxious haven for the modern-day capitalist. 

Today,
the wharf is cultivating a new reputation for itself. A communal area of
infectious energy that is bringing some colour back to the London finance
district.
