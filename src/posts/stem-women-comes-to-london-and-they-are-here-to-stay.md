STEM Women arrived at the
Queen Elizabeth II Centre on Thursday, looking to make a dent in an otherwise male
dominated knowledge workforce. 

For those unfamiliar, the
acronym STEM translates to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. 

Since 2018, STEM Women have
played and will continue to play host to a long line networking and careers
events, designed to introduce aspiring female graduates to inspiring employers
in STEM related industries. 

Speaking to the Managing
Director of STEM Women, Stephen Rooney, he said “events where women can see how
they fit into the industry is very important.”

According to 2018 UCAS data
provided by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA), 35 out of 100
students in STEM related subjects were female.

The size of this gender divide
can be broken down further. 

The percentage of students
studying computer sciences related degrees were recorded as 81 per cent male
and 19 per cent female. 

Equally, the percentage of
female students studying engineering and technology degrees also comprised a
small 19 per cent of total students in 2018. 

A level 2 apprentice in recruitment
and resourcing for TFL commented on the consequences of this inequality. 

“It’s 100 per cent important”
\[referring to women entering STEM subjects]. 

“It encourages a lack of
diverse opinions, leading to things like groupthink” 

As reported in Forbes, a
recent study of 230 senior board members postulates that “the most important
way to alleviate groupthink is to introduce diversity of thought.”

Polly Toynbee, a former Social
Affairs Editor at the BBC, now columnist at The Guardian shares a similar
sentiment. 

“All the evidence shows that
where women are part of the top decision making in companies and organisations
of all kinds, there is less group think.”

“Women in STEM are still
regarded as something of an oddity, and are indeed too few are at the top of
companies” 

“At the time when Margaret
Thatcher, a scientist, arrived in Downing Street, we thought doors would open
to women: all these years later, the doors are open, but only ajar.”

As mentioned by the former
editor, it is not only at the graduate level of industry that women experience
these prevailing inequalities. 

As reported by the Financial
Times (FT) in September, Dame Emma Walmsley, the Chief Executive of Officer
(CEO) of UK drugmaker GSK, is scheduled to step down from her post after an
illustrious eight-year tenure. 

The absence of the Dame will
bring the already small number of female-led FTSE 100 companies down from 9 to 8.

In an interview with Dame Amanda
Blanc (DBE), CEO of Aviva and Non-Executive Director of British Petroleum, surrounding
the importance of women in STEM, she had this to say.

“My daughter is studying
Natural Sciences in Exeter as we speak and wants to be an investment banker
where she’s just gone for one of her internships. She’s been asked to do all
sorts of tests including things like data science which I think is really important.”

“But I would say, irrespective
of the background you come from, as a senior at Aviva, I need to understand
that \[data science] and I have a history degree” she added. 

Continuing, the DBE referenced
the growing popularity of advanced computing practices in industry. 

“It is important that you are
keeping up to speed with what is going on, particularly in Generative AI
because it is going to fundamentally change the way be do business.”
