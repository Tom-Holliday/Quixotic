  "text": "My name is Tom Holliday (BSc in International Business & Applied Finance). I founded Quixotic as an expression of my enduring passion for finance, economics, and the systems that shape modern business. \n Through this blog, I explore the forces driving today’s economic landscape, offering original commentary and perspective on emerging trends. \n The name 'Quixotic' is drawn from the Spanish novel Don Quixote — the tale of an idealistic knight’s pursuit to bring reason to a chaotic world. \n In the same spirit, Quixotic aims to champion truth, rationality, and thoughtful inquiry.",
